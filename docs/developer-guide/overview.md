# Overview

Welcome to the ARO Network Developer Guide! This document serves as an initial introduction for developers interested in exploring and contributing to **ARO Network**, a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) designed to revolutionize peer-to-peer content delivery and AI compute at the edge. 

While our platform is still in its early stages and not yet open to third-party developers, we are excited to share our vision, architecture, and future opportunities for collaboration. We invite you to join us in shaping a global, decentralized edge cloud ecosystem.

### An Open and Fair Network

At its core, ARO Network is designed to be an open and equitable platform where anyone with a stable internet connection can contribute—whether as a node operator or, in the future, as a third-party developer. We welcome developers to join our community and help build a robust global edge network. Your expertise and creativity will be instrumental in unlocking the full potential of decentralized infrastructure, fostering innovation at the edge, and creating new opportunities for Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.

### ARO Network Architecture

ARO’s architecture is built to deliver high-performance edge computing and content delivery. At its foundation, the network aggregates resources from distributed nodes to form a decentralized edge cloud. For developers, we envision an upper-layer application platform that will provide: 

- **SDKs** and **APIs**: Tools to seamlessly integrate third-party applications with ARO’s infrastructure.
- **AI Transformer Components**: Modular building blocks to support AI-driven workloads, such as real-time processing and inference at the edge.


### Our Vision for Third-Party Developers

Our ultimate goal is to empower third-party developers to build innovative applications on ARO’s edge cloud. By leveraging our open platform, developers will be able to create solutions such as:

- **Peer-to-Peer Content Delivery Networks (PCDN)** for faster, cost-effective content distribution.
- **AI Delivery Networks (AiDN)** for decentralized AI model deployment and inference.
- **AI Transformer** Applications for real-time, edge-based AI processing.

These applications will enable developers to establish their own business models, tapping into ARO’s global network of nodes to deliver value to users and enterprises alike. 

### Current Stage and Next Steps

ARO Network is currently in the early phase, our application platform, SDKs, and APIs are still under development and not yet available to third-party developers. However, we are committed to an open and collaborative approach. We warmly invite developers to engage with us, share feedback, and contribute ideas to shape the future of our platform.
