# Installation Guide - VM

### Special Notes for the Existing VM Installations

The VM-based installation method is deprecated and no longer supported due to performance limitations, particularly for edge services like PCDN.

If you are currently using a VM-based installation of the ARO Client (e.g., from the Previewnet phase when VM installations were supported), we strongly recommend migrating to a <Link to="/node-operator-guide/aro-client/choose-installation-method">**supported installation method**</Link> as soon as possible.
