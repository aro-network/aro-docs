# Installation & Initialization Tutorial for ARO Client

## Part 1: ARO Client Deb Package Installation

> Before starting this tutorial, ensure that:  
>   
> - You have installed `Debian` version 11 or higher on a physical machine (not a virtual machine).  
> - You have Admin (root) user access to the system.

> If you havenâ€™t set up the `Debian` operating system yet, please refer to the [**Operating System Tutorial**](/node-operator-guide/aro-client/aro-client-debian).

### 1. Network Preparation & Optimization

> This is a critical step before you start setting up an ARO Client node. An "undesirable" network connection setup may **significantly compromise your node's performance** and count against your mining rewards.  

We recommend **manual set up PPPoE dial-up for Internet connection** on your **physical machine** (that runs `Debian` operating system and hosts your ARO Client): 

1. PPPoE dial-up on `Debian` system: Tutorial
2. Set Bridge Mode on the ONT / Router device: <Link to="/node-operator-guide/improve-performance/network-optimization/#tutorial---how-to-set-bridge-mode-on-an-ont--router">**Tutorial**</Link>

> Why PPPoE dial-up on the physical machine is recommended? Refer to the explanations on "Mode 1" and "Mode 2" in the <Link to="/node-operator-guide/improve-performance/network-optimization/#network-optimization---best-practices">**Best Practices of Network Optimization**</Link>.



### 2. Install the Deb Package

Log in to the terminal, switch to the root user, and execute the following commands:

```bash
apt update

wget -O /tmp/aro-client-1.0.0.deb https://download.aro.network/files/deb/aro-client-1.0.0.deb

apt install -f /tmp/aro-client-1.0.0.deb
```

Execute the following command:

```bash
dpkg -P aro
```


## Part 2: ARO Client Node Initialization & Configuration

This section describes how to register, configure and complete all initial setup needed for a functioning status for your ARO Client node. 

>Make sure you have already completed the Part 1 processes.

1. **Get Your ARO Client Serial Number in the Web Console**  
   Go to the **ARO Client Web Console** at `[Your IP:40001]`
   For example, if your IP is `17.12.205.193`, go to `17.12.205.193:40001` and you will access to the Web Console page. 
   Find the 19-digit **Serial Number** (SN) on top area of the Web Console.

2. **Configure Your Network**  
   You can configure your network connection in the Web Console (if needed).

      ![aro-client-webconsole-03](/img/aro-client/aro-client-webconsole-03.png)

3. **Initialize the Activation Process**   
   Open the [**ARO Dashboard**](https://dashboard.aro.network). Navigate to **ARO Nodes** > **Add an ARO Client**, follow steps and enter the 19-digit **Serial Number** found in your Web Console.  
   ![Device Recognition](/img/node-operator-guide/cmd_finddevice.png)  
   The dashboard will recognize the software image instance and display its information. Confirm to continue.  
   > **Important**: Ensure your ARO Client is online during activation. If it is offline, the process may fail.  

4. **Complete Setup**  
   You will be guided to complete several simple steps for the initial configuration. 
   As the Congratulations Page showes up, you have successfully set up your new **ARO Client**!
