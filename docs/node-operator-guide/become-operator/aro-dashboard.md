# ARO Dashboard

### General Guide

The [**ARO Dashboard**](https://dashboard.ARO.network/) is your all-in-one platform for managing ARO Nodes, campaigns and rewards.

With the ARO Dashboard, you can:

- Create an ARO Account
- Track your Jade Rewards
- Access your Referral Code, invite friends to join ARO, and earn Referral Rewards
- Monitor and manage all your ARO Nodes
- Check your Badge collections

### ARO Account

New users must register an **ARO Account** to get started. Once registered, you can sign in anytime, anywhere to manage your Edge Nodes and related activities.

You can register using an **email address** or a **Google Account**. For email registration, you’ll need to set a password and verify your email.

During registration, you’ll be prompted to enter a **Referral Code**. Using a Referral Code grants a boost on the mining rewards (For Referral rewards please refer to <Link to="/campaign-hub/referral-program">Referral Program Rules</Link>). If you don’t have a code, you can skip this step and add one later in the Dashboard.
