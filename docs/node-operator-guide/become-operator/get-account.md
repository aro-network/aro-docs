# Create Your ARO Account 

## Understanding ARO Accounts

The ARO Network features a secure account system, uniquely identified by an `Account UID` and registered on-chain. As a user, you don’t need to worry about the technical details because your ARO Account is automatically created when you sign up through the ARO Dashboard.

Currently, the ARO Dashboard supports two convenient methods for signing up and signing in:

- **Email**: Use a valid email address to sign up. You’ll receive a verification code during the process and will need to set a password for signing in. This email will also be used to receive a verification code if you need to reset your password.
- **Google Account**: Enjoy a seamless, one-click sign-up and sign-in experience using your Google Account, offering a more user-friendly option.

## Start Your Journey with an ARO Account

To get started, visit the [**ARO Dashboard**](https://dashboard.aro.network/) and sign up for your new account.

For more details on how the ARO Dashboard works, please refer to <Link to="/node-operator-guide/become-operator/aro-dashboard">**this guide**</Link>.
