# Network Optimization for Your Edge Nodes

## General Introduction

Optimizing the network for Edge Nodes (`ARO Pod`, `ARO Link`, and `ARO Client`) can greatly enhance performance and rewards. This tutorial explains the fundamental principles and concepts of network optimization, with suggested approaches of constructing your network connection for your Edge Nodes.

## Basic Principles of Network Optimization for Edge Nodes

### What is NAT?

Network optimization for Edge Nodes aims to improve how data travels between the node and the internet. A core principle is minimizing obstacles in the network path, often by reducing the number of **`Network Address Translation(NAT)`** layers. Fewer layers typically lead to better connectivity and performance, as each layer can introduce delays or restrictions in data flow.

The key principle here is achieving a **NAT type that is friendlier to Edge Services**. NAT types determine how easily external connections can reach your node. Less restrictive types enable smoother communication, which is advantageous for tasks like data sharing or cloud operations. By adjusting your network setup, you can influence the NAT type to be more open and efficient while maintaining necessary security.

### How To Achieve Better NAT Types

A simple principle is: **minimize the number of NAT layers between the device and the public network** to make it easier for the public network to access your device.

1. The device directly obtaining a public IP is optimal;
2. The device behind a single NAT device (e.g., an optical network terminal / ONT) is suboptimal;
3. Other scenarios, involving two or more NAT layers, are less ideal, as node performance will be significantly compromised or edge services may completely fail to operate.

## Network Optimization - Best Practices

### Two Suggested Practices

#### Mode 1 (optimal)
![mode 1](/img/node-operator-guide/optimize-mode1.png)

- `Optical Networking Terminal` (`ONT`) is the device at the end of a fiber optic network that converts the light signals from the fiber optic cable into signals that your devices can read, like routers and ARO Devices.
- **PPPoE on ARO Device**
	- `PPPoE`, or `Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet`, is a networking protocol that provides authentication and a secure, managed connection to the internet. On a router (or an ONT), the PPPoE setting is the login information provided by your ISP, including a username and password, which the router uses to authenticate and get a public IP address. 
	- PPPoE allocates Public IP directly to the ARO Device, hence reducing NAT layers and benefiting ARO Device's performance. 
- **ONT set to `bridge mode`**
	- `bridge mode` is a network setting that disables an ONT or router's routing functions, such as NAT and DHCP. This turns the device into a simple pass-through "bridge", which reduces one NAT layer.

The **Mode 1** is optimal for Edge Services because the ARO Node is allocated with a `Public IP` and there is no extra NAT layer introduced. 

#### Mode 2 (suboptimal)
![mode 2](/img/node-operator-guide/optimize-mode2.png)

- **PPPoE on the ONT**
- **Set UPnP or DMZ on the ONT**
	- The `Universal Plug and Play` (`UPnP`) is a protocol that allows devices on your local network, such as gaming consoles or smart TVs, to automatically set up port forwarding rules without manual intervention. This can improve performance for online activities that require direct connections.
	- A `Demilitarized Zone` (`DMZ`) host is a single device on your network that is completely exposed to the public internet, bypassing the router's firewall entirely. This is an extreme measure that enhances your exposure to the Internet while introduces some risks.
	- As PPPoE on the ONT device introduce an extra NAT layer, enabling `UPnP` or `DMZ` is favored to improve the connectivity for the connected devices in the LAN. 
	- Warning: enable either `UPnP` or `DMZ`. **DO NOT enable both of them**.   

The **Mode 2** is suboptimal for Edge Services because only one more NAT layer is introduced and you can still connect other devices like a Wi-Fi router to the ONT.

### Tutorial - How to Set Bridge Mode on an ONT / Router

#### Requirements
- Admin access to ONT/router (username/password, often "admin/admin").
- Computer connected via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- Your own router with WAN port.
- ISP login details (e.g., PPPoE credentials) if required.

#### Steps

1. **Access Web Interface**
   - Connect to ONT/router via Ethernet.
   - Open browser, enter device IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.0.1`, or `192.168.100.1`).
   - Log in with admin credentials (check with ISP if unknown).

2. **Enable Bridge Mode**
   - Go to **WAN**, **Internet**, or **Advanced** settings.
   - Find **Bridge Mode**, **Passthrough**, or **Modem Mode**.
   - Disable DHCP and Wi-Fi. Save changes (device may reboot).

3. **Connect Your Router**
   - Connect ONT’s LAN port to your router’s WAN port.
   - Configure router WAN to **DHCP** or **PPPoE** (use ISP credentials if needed).
   - Clone ONT’s MAC address if required. Restart router.

4. **Test Connection**
   - Check public IP at `whatismyipaddress.com`.
   - Run a speed test.
   - **Issues?** Reboot devices, verify WAN settings, or contact ISP.

#### Warnings
- Bridge mode disables ONT’s Wi-Fi/routing—use your router.
- May void ISP support.
- Revert via ONT’s interface if needed.

### Tutorial - Set Up PPPoE on a Debian System

#### Requirements
- Debian installed on a physical machine (e.g., Debian 11 or later).
- Admin (root) access to the system.
- Ethernet connection to a modem/ONT (configured in bridge mode if needed).
- ISP-provided PPPoE credentials.
- Network interface name (e.g., `eth0`, find using `ip link`).

#### Steps

1. **Install PPPoE Software**
   - Open a terminal and update the package list:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install the PPPoE client:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install pppoe pppoeconf
     ```

2. **Configure PPPoE**
   - Run the PPPoE configuration tool:
     ```bash
     sudo pppoeconf
     ```
   - Follow the prompts:
     - Select your network interface (e.g., `eth0`).
     - Enter your ISP-provided username and password.
     - Accept defaults for MTU, MSS, and other settings unless specified by your ISP.
     - Choose to start the connection on boot (recommended).
   - Save the configuration.

3. **Start the PPPoE Connection**
   - Activate the connection:
     ```bash
     sudo pon dsl-provider
     ```
   - Verify the connection:
     ```bash
     ip addr show ppp0
     ```
     Look for an assigned IP address on the `ppp0` interface.

4. **Test and Troubleshoot**
   - Test internet access:
     ```bash
     ping 8.8.8.8
     ```
   - Check your public IP at `whatismyipaddress.com`.
   - **Issues?**
     - Verify credentials in `/etc/ppp/pap-secrets` or `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets`.
     - Ensure the modem/ONT is in bridge mode (see related guides).
     - Restart the connection: `sudo poff dsl-provider && sudo pon dsl-provider`.
     - Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u pppd`.

#### Warnings & Tips
- If using an ONT or a router, ensure it’s not also running PPPoE to avoid conflicts.
- For model-specific issues (e.g., specific ISPs or hardware), search “[ISP] Debian PPPoE setup” or provide details for tailored steps.
