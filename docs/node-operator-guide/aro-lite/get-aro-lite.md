# Get ARO Lite
## ARO Lite

For those seeking an accessible entry point to ARO Network, **ARO Lite** nodes operate as lightweight browser extensions, such as a Chrome extension. These nodes enable anyone to join the ARO Network with minimal cost and effort.

By deploying ARO Lite, ARO facilitates exploratory resource building in new markets, establishing a distributed network of `Checker Nodes` needed for maintaining the network. This makes ARO Lite an ideal way to expand the AROâ€™s user base and enhance the security and integrity for the entire network.


## Download ARO Lite

We offer two methods for downloading and installing ARO Lite. You can select either option from the Dashboard under **ARO Nodes > Add New Node > ARO Lite**.

### 1. Google Web Store (Recommended)

We recommend downloading ARO Lite from the official **Google Web Store**.

Visit the [ARO Lite page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aro-lite/dehgjeidddkjakjgnmpccdkkjdchiifh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) and click **Add to Chrome** to complete the installation. Alternatively, use the download link provided on the Dashboard under **ARO Nodes > Add New Node > ARO Lite**.

### 2. Manually Install in Developer Mode

Manual installation is a backup option for urgent updates or bug fixes if the Google Web Store experiences delays.

You need to manually update the extension (downloading and installing new ones) when there is a new version. 

Follow these steps to install manually:

1. Download the ARO Lite package to your local device.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Load Unpacked** (the button in the top-right corner).
3. Select the local file, unpack, and install.
