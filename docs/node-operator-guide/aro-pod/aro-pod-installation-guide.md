This guide is for you if:

Watch this [**quick video guide**](https://youtu.be/ok8RW8hhYAw) for an easy onboarding experience.

### Step 1: Plug In

Setting up an **ARO Pod** is simple and intuitive with their plug-and-play design.

**Unbox** your device, **power it on**, and **connect it to the internet using the provided cable**. This process takes about a minute. Ensure a stable internet connection before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Add Device to Your Dashboard

Ensure you’ve created an **ARO Account** (ARO ID) and are logged in to the Dashboard.

You’ll be prompted to enter the **Serial Number (SN)** of your device, which is printed on the device label. Enter it carefully to avoid errors.

If successful, the Dashboard will recognize your device, and you can complete the setup with a few clicks.

### Step 3: Ready to Go!

Once the device is added, a **device card** will appear on the **Edge Node** page. Your first ARO Edge Node is now ready to operate!

Click on the card to check running details of your node.
