# Why ARO Network

### Edge Cloud: A Closer Cloud

The concept of Edge Cloud is simple: **bring cloud servers physically closer to users**.

In computer science, physical proximity matters. Running a program closer to the request’s origin—at the **network edge**—delivers faster responses for end users. This is the essence of Edge Cloud and where it gets its name.

### You Use Edge Cloud Every Day

Edge Cloud is a critical part of modern digital infrastructure, seamlessly supporting services used by billions daily.

For example, YouTube doesn’t always serve videos directly from centralized data centers. Instead, it caches high-demand content on regional edge servers closer to users, enhancing speed and reliability. **Edge Cloud powers today’s content-rich internet**.
