# ARO Testnet Campaign Guide

## What is ARO Testnet

**ARO Previewnet** is now live! 

ARO’s decentralized Edge Cloud journey unfolds across three stages: `Previewnet`, `Testnet` **(where we are now)**, and `Mainnet`, each with a unique mission.

- **Previewnet**: Welcomes you to discover ARO, try its features, and prepare for the next phase while we recruit community members and identify early contributors.
- **Testnet**: Kicks off ARO’s initial expansion, testing real-world, commercialized resource delivery with numerous edge nodes across regions, and refining technology and economics, in a live test mode.
- **Mainnet**: Signals ARO’s full launch, expanding node coverage and offering massive scale edge services, embodying our “Value-added Bandwidth” vision with AI-powered enhancements.

## How Incentives Work in the ARO Testnet

The ARO Testnet introduces two parallel incentive systems—the **Jade System** and the **Badge System**—designed to reward node operators, community members (ARONAUTs), partners, and other contributors during the Testnet phase.

### Jade System for Resource Growth

The ARO Network is a decentralized Edge Cloud, and our goal is to onboard as many edge resources (such as unused internet bandwidth) as possible to validate our business model. During the Testnet, `Jade` serves as the primary quantifiable reward for running ARO Nodes of any type and contributing edge resources.

The ARO Network measures the internet bandwidth and data traffic of active nodes, awarding `Jade` points based on each node’s quantifiable workload and network performance.

The Testnet is a true "Mining Competition" for earning Jade rewards. All `Edge Nodes` (`ARO Pod`, `ARO Client`, `ARO Link`) compete for a major Jade rewards pool, which accounts for `83.15%` of the total Jade supply. Meanwhile, all `Checker Nodes` (`ARO Lite`) compete for a separate rewards pool, representing `9.24%` of the total Jade supply.

The mining competition ensures a fair opportunity for all ARO Nodes from the first day to the final day of the Testnet phase.

### Badges for Community Growth

The Testnet also features a **Badge System**, which awards `Badges` to users who contribute to the network, community, and broader ARO ecosystem.

Eligible contributions for earning Badges are diverse, ensuring that exceptional efforts beyond providing edge resources are recognized and rewarded through ARO’s comprehensive incentive system.

Check your Badge collection on the **Dashboard->Campaign** page.

Badges are non-transferable.

### Future Rewards

**Both Jades and Badges are key metrics for determining eligibility for future drops after the Testnet ends**.

`5%` of the total supply of `$ARO` tokens will be allocated to all pre-TGE (before `$ARO` token can be utilized as an incentives to edge resource providers) users for their valuable support and contributions to the development of the ARO Network.

### For Users from Previewnet

For users who joined the ARO Network during the Previewnet phase: your user accounts, referrals, Jade rewards (including Jade in lock), connected social accounts, and completed tasks will seamlessly carry over to the Testnet environment.

Jades earned in the Previewnet will be migrated to the Testnet, with an amplification factor applied as a special bonus for early adopters. All Jades emitted in the Previewnet will be migrate to the Testnet and account for `7.61%` of the total Jade supply.  

For `Jade in Lock` carried over from the Previewnet: Unlock these by running any type of ARO Node in the Testnet for approximately 30 days. For example, if you earned `Jade in Lock` by ordering ARO Pods in the Previewnet, running an ARO Pod for about 30 days will unlock all those Jades.

## Things You Can Do in the Testnet

Boost your Jade and Badge rewards through engaging activities:

1. **Join the ARO Community—Become an ARONAUT!**

2. **Deploy and Run an ARO Node—The More the Better!**  
   The Testnet is the ultimate stage for your ARO Nodes, regardless of type. Set up and optimize your ARO Nodes to compete for daily Jade reward emissions!

3. **Get Extra Bonus from the Referral Program**  
   Invite friends through the **Referral Program** to earn commissions: 15% from direct referrals and 2% from second-level invites in Jades. High-quality referrals may also earn you exclusive Badges.
