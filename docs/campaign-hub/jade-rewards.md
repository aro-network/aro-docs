# Jade Rewards Guide

## What Is Jade?

During the **Previewnet** and **Testnet** phases, **`Jade`** serves as your primary reward currency, redeemable for ARO Networkâ€™s native token (`$ARO`) during future drops. Think of Jade as points you earn based on your contributions.

## Jade Rewards During the Testnet Stage

### How to Earn Jade During the Testnet Stage?

During the Testnet stage, you can earn Jade by **operating ARO nodes** and **competing with other node operators to provide bandwidth resources at the edge**. For more details, visit <Link to="/campaign-hub/aro-testnet">ARO Testnet Campaign page</Link>

Additionally, you can earn a **Referral Bonus** by inviting friends to participate. Learn more on the <Link to="/campaign-hub/referral-program">Referral Program page</Link>.

### Jade Rewards Breakdown

A detailed breakdown chart is available under **My Jade Rewards** on the Dashboard's home page.

Below is a breakdown of reward types and their explanations:

- **ARO Pod**: Mining rewards earned by operating ARO Pods in the Testnet.
- **ARO Link**: Mining rewards earned by operating ARO Links in the Testnet.
- **ARO Client**: Mining rewards earned by operating ARO Clients in the Testnet.
- **ARO Lite**: Mining rewards earned by operating ARO Lite nodes in the Testnet.
- **Referral Bonus**: Commission earned from your 1-tier and 2-tier referees.
- **Campaign**: Jade earned through campaigns, such as the Previewnet Referral Sprint.
- **Campaign (Locked)**: Jade earned from campaigns but currently in `locked` status.

### Jade in Locked Status

Locked Jade (also referred to as "Jade in Lock") represents Jade rewards that are currently in `locked` status. You may earn locked Jade through specific community campaigns or by completing designated tasks. 

The amount of locked Jade will be displayed in the Jade Rewards Breakdown Chart.

In the Testnet stage, locked Jade can be unlocked based on your performance in operating ARO nodes:

- Unlock `450` Jade by running an **ARO Pod** or **ARO Link** for one day (with at least 8 hours of uptime).
- Unlock `150` Jade by running an **ARO Client** for one day (with at least 8 hours of uptime).
- Unlock `50` Jade by running an **ARO Lite** for one day (with at least 8 hours of uptime).

**Special Notes on the Unlocking Rules:**

- Running multiple nodes can accelerate the unlocking process.
- Any Jade remaining in `locked` status will expire (you lose them!) when the Testnet concludes.
- If you earn locked Jade as a Referral Bonus, it will be and **ONLY** be unlocked in sync with your referees' unlocking progress. In other words, when your referees unlock their Jade, your corresponding Referral Bonus will also be unlocked. 
- If you earn locked Jade by completing designated tasks (like *"Run an ARO Node"* during the Previewent Campaign), it will be and **ONLY** be unlocked by yourself (running ARO Nodes during the Testnet).


## FAQ

- **Can I transfer Jade?**  
  No, Jade is not a token and **CANNOT** be transferred at this stage.
- **How much ARO token is reserved for the redemption with Jade?**  
  Up to `5%` of the total ARO token supply will be specifically reserved for community incentives, which will be dropped to the ARO Community in the future. Both Jade and Badge will be key metrics in determining your final rewards.
