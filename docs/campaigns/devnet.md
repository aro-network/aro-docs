# ARO Devnet

Welcome to the ARO Devnet! Watch this [**quick video guide**](https://youtu.be/ok8RW8hhYAw) to get started.

### 1. Plug It In
In the Devnet, you can explore how Edge Nodes operate within the ARO Edge Cloud.

Choose your preferred option:
- **ARO Pod**: A dedicated plug-and-play device optimized for home use, offering high uptime and efficient reward generation.
- **ARO Link**: A Wi-Fi router with a built-in ARO client, allowing you to earn rewards while browsing.
- **ARO Client** (coming soon): Install the ARO Software Image on your own device, such as a PC, workstation, or data center. Ideal for advanced users.

### 2. Install It
Installing an Edge Node connects your device to the ARO Network (Edge Cloud). Follow these steps to set up and configure your node:

1. Create an **ARO Account** on the [ARO Devnet Dashboard](https://devnet-dashboard.ARO.network). Registration is straightforward, and entering a Referral Code provides extra benefits.
2. Choose to run a **Hardware Node** (**ARO Pod** or **ARO Link**). Software Nodes will be available later.

### 3. Start Your ARO Journey
Congratulations! You’re ready to begin your journey as an Edge Node operator in the ARO Devnet.

What you gain from the Devnet:
- **Early Access**: The Devnet is distinct from the Testnet and is not fully open for large-scale community testing. Joining early helps you become familiar with ARO’s functionality and prepares you for Testnet and Mainnet phases.
- **Feedback Matters**: Your input is invaluable in improving the ARO Network, especially at this early stage.
- **Rewards**: While real mining rewards are not available on Devnet, your participation will be recognized, and you’ll receive rewards when the Devnet phase concludes.
