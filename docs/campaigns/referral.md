# Referral Program

## Referral Program Rules

### Overview

The **Referral Program** is a long-term initiative designed to grow the ARO community and user base.

This program benefits everyone. Both referrers and referees enjoy additional rewards by inviting friends to join the ARO Network or by being referred.

### Benefits for the Referrer

The **Referrer** (the person who invites others to join the ARO Network) earns an additional **Referral Bonus** added to their total rewards.

The **Referral Bonus** is calculated as a percentage of the Rewards earned by referees (the commission rate). 

> **Note**: The commission rate may change with policy updates. Check the latest policy in the **Referral** section of your Dashboard.

The bonus currently applies to **first-tier referees** with `15%` commission rate, plus **second-tier referees** with `2%` commission rate. 

>Example: If A (you) refers B, and B refers C, then B is your first-tier referee, and C is your second-tier referee. You can earn 15% of what B has earned, and 2% of what C has earned. B and C still earn 100% of their rewards. 

### Benefits for the Referee

In Previewnet, the **Referee** (the person being invited) receives an immediate amd instant 200 Jade reward. 

The reward applies instantly after entering a Referral Code during initial account setup. The user may also enter a Referral Code later, and the reward will be applied accordingly.
