# ARO Previewnet Campaign Guide

## What is ARO Previewnet

**ARO Previewnet** is now live! 

As the first phase of the ARO Network—a decentralized edge cloud—this campaign marks our exciting debut. 

ARO’s journey unfolds across three stages: Previewnet (where we are now), Testnet, and Mainnet, each with a unique mission.

- **Previewnet**: Welcomes you to discover ARO, try its features, and prepare for the next phase while we recruit community members and identify early contributors.
- **Testnet**: Kicks off ARO’s initial expansion, testing resource delivery with numerous edge nodes across regions, refining technology and economics in a live test mode.
- **Mainnet**: Signals ARO’s full launch, expanding node coverage and offering real edge services like PCDN, embodying our “Value-added Bandwidth” vision with AI-powered enhancements.

## Earn Jade in ARO Previewnet

During Previewnet and Testnet, `Jade` serve as your primary quantifiable reward, redeemable for ARO Network’s native token (`$ARO`) upon Mainnet launch. In Previewnet, earn Jades by completing specific tasks or meeting criteria—we encourage your actions like joining our community, spreading the word, inviting friends, or purchasing/running nodes, with rewards varying by effort.

For detailed specifics on how Jade works, check the <Link to="/campaigns/jade">**Jade Rewards Page**</Link>.

>**Special Note**: Running nodes in Previewnet does not yield real rewards for you. We want you to explore ARO with ease and low risk in this beginning stage, gearing up for Testnet’s fierce mining competition where bigger Jade incentives await!

## Things You Can Do in Previewnet

Boost your Jades with these engaging activities:

1. **Join the ARO Community & Complete Social Tasks**  
   Manage tasks in your ARO Dashboard—simple actions like connecting social accounts, following, or retweeting on Twitter. Finish them just in one minute to rack up more Jades!

2. **Deploy an ARO Node**  
   Though Previewnet nodes generate only simulation points, deploying or purchasing a device earns you Jades unlockable via Testnet mining. Just get it running to claim your rewards!

3. **Participate in the Referral Program & Leaderboard**  
   Invite friends through the **Referral Program** to earn commissions: 15% from direct referrals and 2% from second-level invites. More invites, especially high-quality ones, mean more Jades!  
   Climb the **Referral Leaderboard** for real-time rankings, with the top users sharing a $30,000 USDT cash prize.  
   See <Link to="/campaigns/referral">**Referral Program Page**</Link> for details.

4. **Contribute More to the ARO Community**  
   Beyond Jades, unlock exclusive rewards like badges, NFTs, or surprise perks by:  
   - Joining the <Link to="/campaigns/pioneer">**Pioneer Program Page**</Link> as an early adopter and tester.  
   - Staying active—contribute by managing community efforts, writing articles, or creating tutorials.  

These steps not only boost your Jades but also position you for unique ARO benefits in the coming future.
