# Jade

### What Are Jades?

Before mainnet is live, your contributions to the **ARO Testnet** will be tracked and reflected as **Jade Shards** (or just **Jades** for simpler term). You will be rewarded with Jades when you participate, run Edge Nodes, and make contributions to the ARO Testnet. 

In some cases, community contributors may receive NFTs as a recognition of their special efforts. 

The Jades serve as a key metric to determine your eligibility for future rewards. On Mainnet launch, you will be able to exchange your Jades for **$ARO tokens**.

### How To Earn Jades?

In the **Previewnet** Phase, you will be rewarded with Jades by completing a variety of tasks in the Previewnet Campaign. 

In the **Testnet** Phase, you will be rewarded with Jades by running your Edge Nodes in ARO Network.
