# Jade Rewards Guide

## What Is Jade?

During the **Previewnet** and **Testnet** phases, **`Jade`** serves as your primary reward currency, redeemable for ARO Network’s native token (`$ARO`) during community drops upon **Mainnet** launch. Think of Jade as points you earn based on your contributions—a stepping stone to future benefits!

In Previewnet, you can easily earn Jade by completing simple tasks or meeting specific criteria. Whether you’re a casual participant or an active contributor, there’s a Jade reward for everyone—check your progress on the [ARO Dashboard](https://dashboard.aro.network)!

### Jade in Lock
Some Previewnet tasks, like redeeming Gift Codes or running/purchasing ARO Nodes, grant **Jade in Lock**—rewards temporarily held for later. These Jades unlock during Testnet when you run nodes, turning your early efforts into real value.

## Jade in Mainnet
