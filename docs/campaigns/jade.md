# Jade Rewards Guide

## What Is Jade?

During the **Previewnet** and **Testnet** phases, Jade serves as your primary reward currency, redeemable for ARO Network’s native token (`$ARO`) during community drops upon **Mainnet** launch. Think of Jade as points you earn based on your contributions—a stepping stone to future benefits!

## Jade in Previewnet

### How to Earn Jade in Previewnet
In Previewnet, you can easily earn Jade by completing simple tasks or meeting specific criteria. Whether you’re a casual participant or an active contributor, there’s a Jade reward for everyone—check your progress on the [ARO Dashboard](https://dashboard.aro.network)!

### Jade in Lock
Some Previewnet tasks, like redeeming Gift Codes or running/purchasing ARO Nodes, grant **Jade in Lock**—rewards temporarily held for later. These Jades unlock during Testnet when you run nodes, turning your early efforts into real value.

### Preview Jade
Running nodes in Previewnet generates **Preview Jade**, shown as simulation mining rewards on the **Node Details** page of your ARO Dashboard. This simulates your potential earnings, preparing you for Testnet’s real Jade rewards—Preview Jade itself isn’t a true reward.

> **Why Simulation Rewards?** We designed Previewnet for low-risk exploration, letting you test ARO products comfortably while gearing up for Testnet’s intense mining competition with bigger Jade incentives!

### Redeem More Jade
Boost your Jade with redeemable options using **Gift Codes** or **Order Numbers**:

- **Gift Codes**: Snag these from offline events, community campaigns, or giveaways. The more you engage, the better your chances!
- **ARO Pod Order Number**: Redeem 4500 Jade per ARO Pod purchase using the Order Number from your confirmation email.

> **Note**: All redeemed Jades start as **Jade in Lock**, awaiting Testnet unlocking.

## Jade in Testnet

### How to Earn Jade in Testnet
In Testnet, earn Jade by running ARO Nodes and competing with other resource providers (miners). Expect significantly higher rewards than Previewnet.

### Unlocking Jade in Lock
During Testnet, activate your **Jade in Lock** from Previewnet by running nodes and collecting mining yields. The more you mine, the faster you unlock these rewards. Full details will be shared before Testnet launches.

## Jade in Mainnet

### Transitioning to $ARO
With Mainnet launch, `$ARO` becomes ARO Network’s native token, replacing Jade as the reward for node contributions. Jade holders can then redeem their points for `$ARO` during community drop events. Stay tuned for launch details!
