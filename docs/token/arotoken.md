# `$ARO`

## Introduction

**`$ARO` serves as the core of the ARO Network, powering all interactions among various participants within the ecosystem.** It underpins collaboration between infrastructure providers, edge application developers, and end users，forming the economic and coordination layer of a decentralized edge cloud architecture.

The overall mechanism of `$ARO` ensures that as the network scales, value generated within the ecosystem is **systematically captured and redistributed to `$ARO` and its holders**. This mechanism promotes aligned incentives across all participants, fostering an open, collaborative, and sustainably growing ecosystem.

## Token Utilities

**`$ARO` is the native utility token of the ARO Network and serves as a fundamental component of the ecosystem.** It fulfills multiple roles that are essential to the functioning, growth, and sustainability of the network：

### Payment

`$ARO` serves as the primary medium of value exchange within the ARO Network. Professional users can use it to access underlying resources and deploy edge applications, while everyday users can leverage it to access various services within the platform. A granular, usage-based pricing model underpins a highly liquid and flexible market.

### Ecosystem Incentives

All contributions that add value to the network are rewarded with `$ARO`, such as providing high-quality infrastructure resources, maintaining network operations, and developing both foundational infrastructure and edge applications. This contribution-based incentive mechanism attracts high-quality builders and participants to co-develop the network.

### Keeper Node Staking & Network Security

ARO Network adopts a **GPoS (Guarantee Proof of Stake)** consensus mechanism. `Keeper Node` operators and delegators must stake `$ARO` as collateral to participate as validators, thereby securing the network. `Keeper Nodes` earn `$ARO` rewards by distributing tasks, validating workloads, and maintaining consensus. A slashing mechanism is also in place to ensure the network remains stable and efficient.

### Governance

`$ARO` holders can participate in protocol governance through on-chain voting. Token holders have the ability to propose and vote on key decisions, ensuring the network’s development aligns with the community’s vision and real needs.

### Diverse Use Cases

As the ARO ecosystem evolves, the scope of `$ARO` will continue to expand. It will become a critical medium of value exchange across an increasingly diverse set of use cases, laying a strong foundation for the network’s future scalability and adoption.
