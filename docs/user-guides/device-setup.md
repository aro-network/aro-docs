### Get Started with Your New Hardware Device!

This guide is for you if:
- You’ve received your new Hardware Node (e.g., **ARO Pod** or **ARO Link**) and want to set it up.
- You need help adding your new device to your Dashboard.

Watch this [**quick video guide**](https://youtu.be/ok8RW8hhYAw) for an easy onboarding experience.

### Step 1: Plug In

Setting up Hardware Nodes like the **ARO Pod** or **ARO Link** is simple and intuitive with their plug-and-play design.

**Unbox** your device, **power it on**, and **connect it to the internet using the provided cable**. This process takes about a minute. Ensure a stable internet connection before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Add Device to Your Dashboard

Ensure you’ve created an **ARO Account** (ARO ID) and are logged in to the Dashboard.

> For account creation instructions, refer to <Link to="/user-guides/dashboard">this guide</Link>.

On the **Edge Node** page in your Dashboard, locate the **"Add Your Edge Node"** button (or the small button in the top-right corner).

Click the button and select **Hardware Node** to start the setup process.

> **Note**: The device **must** be online (powered on and connected to the internet) during this process.

You’ll be prompted to enter the **Serial Number (SN)** of your device, which is printed on the device label. Enter it carefully to avoid errors.

If successful, the Dashboard will recognize your device, and you can complete the setup with a few clicks.

### Step 3: Ready to Go!

Once the device is added, a **device card** will appear on the **Edge Node** page. Your first ARO Edge Node is now ready to operate!

Click on the card to check running details of your node.
