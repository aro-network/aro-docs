# ARO Dashboard

### General Guide

The [ARO Dashboard](https://dashboard.ARO.network/) is your all-in-one platform for managing ARO Nodes, campaigns and rewards.

With the ARO Dashboard, you can:

- Create an ARO Account
- Access to your Previewnet Campaign page
- Access your Referral Code, invite friends to join ARO, and earn Referral Rewards
- Manage all your ARO Nodes
- Track and manage your rewards
- Manage your funds (Coming soon)

### ARO Account

New users must register an **ARO Account** to get started. Once registered, you can sign in anytime, anywhere to manage your Edge Nodes and related activities.

You can register using an **email address** or a **Google Account**. For email registration, you’ll need to set a password and verify your email.

During registration, you’ll be prompted to enter a **Referral Code**. Using a Referral Code grants a instant Jade reward. If you don’t have a code, you can skip this step and add one later in the Dashboard.

### What’s in the Dashboard?

![Dashboard Topbar](/img/user-guides/dashboard_topbar.png)

The **topbar** provides access to all available pages:

- **Campaign**: This is your page for the main campaign in <Link to="/campaigns/previewnet">**ARO Previewnet**</Link>.

- **ARO Node**: View and manage all ARO Nodes linked to your ARO Account. You can add new nodes or remove existing ones. Clicking a device card displays detailed information about the node.

  > To learn how to add a new node to the Dashboard, refer to the **User Guides** in this Docs based on your selected node types.

- **Mining Stats**: Monitor the number of ARO Nodes you’re running, their online status, and the total rewards earned from operating them. 

  > Special Remind: In **Previewnet** phase, running ARO Nodes will **NOT** yield any real rewards. Please refer to <Link to="/campaigns/previewnet">**ARO Previewnet**</Link> page for details. 
- **ARO Account**: Manage basic account settings and operations for your ARO Account.
