# Choose Your Node

### Things To Know Before You Start
Here are key points to understand before running an Edge Node on the ARO Network:

1. ARO is a **permissionless** network, meaning no prior permission or qualification is required to join.
2. A stable internet connection is essential. Higher bandwidth and connection stability significantly increase your rewards from running an Edge Node.
3. The **region** where you run your Edge Node matters. Being closer to end users enhances their access to internet content, resulting in higher rewards.
4. You can exit the network and claim your rewards at any time.
5. Edge Nodes primarily utilize your **idle internet resources** to serve the ARO Edge Network, with minimal impact on your regular internet experience. The choice is always yours.
6. You can run either a **Hardware Node** or a **Software Node** (software solutions will be available soon). Refer to the next section for guidance on choosing the best option.
