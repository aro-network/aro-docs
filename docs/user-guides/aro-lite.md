# ARO Lite Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the process of downloading, installing and running of **ARO Lite browser extension**.

## Download & Install ARO Lite

We provide two approaches for downloading and installing ARO Lite.

You can choose either approach from the Dashboard -> ARO Nodes > Add New Node -> ARO Lite.

### 1. Google Web Store (Recommended)

We recommend you to download ARO Lite from the official **Google Web Store**.

Go to Google Web Store [ARO Lite page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aro-lite/dehgjeidddkjakjgnmpccdkkjdchiifh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) and click **Add to Chrome** to finish installation. 

Or you can just download by clicking the download link provided by the Dashboard -> ARO Nodes > Add New Node -> ARO Lite page.

### 2. Manually Install in Developer Mode

The manual installation serves as a back up approach in case of a time delay on the Google Web Store when there is an urgent version update or bug fixing.

To manually install, follow steps below:

1. Download the ARO Lite package to your local file. 
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and click on **Load Unpack** (the button on the top right)
3. Choose the local file, unpack and install.

## ARO Lite Initialization (Add ARO Lite to You Dashboard)

Follow the steps below and it takes only one minite.

Step 1: Go to Dashboard -> ARO Nodes > Add New Node -> ARO Lite page, and open your newly installed ARO Lite extension.
