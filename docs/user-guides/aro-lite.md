# ARO Lite Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the process of downloading, installing, and running the **ARO Lite browser extension**.

## Download & Install ARO Lite

We offer two methods for downloading and installing ARO Lite. You can select either option from the Dashboard under **ARO Nodes > Add New Node > ARO Lite**.

### 1. Google Web Store (Recommended)

We recommend downloading ARO Lite from the official **Google Web Store**.

Visit the [ARO Lite page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aro-lite/dehgjeidddkjakjgnmpccdkkjdchiifh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) and click **Add to Chrome** to complete the installation. Alternatively, use the download link provided on the Dashboard under **ARO Nodes > Add New Node > ARO Lite**.

### 2. Manually Install in Developer Mode

Manual installation is a backup option for urgent updates or bug fixes if the Google Web Store experiences delays.

Follow these steps to install manually:

1. Download the ARO Lite package to your local device.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Load Unpacked** (the button in the top-right corner).
3. Select the local file, unpack, and install.

## ARO Lite Initialization (Add ARO Lite to Your Dashboard)

Follow these steps—it takes just one minute!

**Step 1**: Go to the Dashboard under **ARO Nodes > Add New Node > ARO Lite**, and open your newly installed ARO Lite extension.

**Step 3**: Proceed, and you’ll see a "Adding ARO Lite Successful" message.  

At the same time, your ARO Lite extension will display a working panel showing your current network quality status and Jade rewards earned by this extension.
